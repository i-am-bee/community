### Become a contributor

1. Familiar youself with the [BeeAI contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
2. The [BeeAI developer guideline](https://github.com/i-am-bee/BeeAI/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#developing) is the starting point for contributors to make code or doc contributions.

If you're looking for something to do to get your feet wet working on BeeAI, look for GitHub issues
marked with the Help Wanted label:

- [Primary BeeAI repo](https://github.com/i-am-bee/BeeAI/issues)

Of course, even if there's not an issue opened for it, you can always do more
testing throughout the platform. Similarly, you can always contribute more docs, richer docs,
insightful docs. Or maybe a cool blog post?

## Questions and issues

Please feel free to connect with us using the [discussion section](https://github.com/i-am-bee/BeeAI/discussions) of the main BeeAI repository.
