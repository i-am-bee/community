# Docling Community

Welcome to the Docling community!

This is the starting point for becoming a contributor - improving code, extending docs, giving talks, etc.

## Introduction

The mission of Docling is to simplify document processing, parsing diverse formats — including advanced PDF understanding — and providing seamless integrations with the gen AI ecosystem.
It is hosted as [incubation project](https://lfaidata.foundation/projects/) in [LF AI & Data Foundation](https://lfaidata.foundation/).

## Docling authors
Docling is an open source project with an active development community. The project was started
by the AI for Knowledge team in the IBM Research Europe - Zurich lab.

## Governance

The governance of the project is described in the [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md) file.

The Steering Committee meets regularly. You can find the meeting notes in [meeting-notes](./steering-commitee/meeting-notes/).

## How can I help ?

To get involved in our community you can ask questions, be a part of the conversation, or contribute to Docling's growth.
Docling is an open source project that is driven by the participation of users and contributors. Join in!

### Become a contributor

1. Familiar youself with the [Docling contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
2. The [Docling developer guideline](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#developing) is the starting point for contributors to make code or doc contributions.

If you're looking for something to do to get your feet wet working on Docling, look for GitHub issues
marked with the Help Wanted label:

- [Primary Docling repo](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20)

Of course, even if there's not an issue opened for it, you can always do more
testing throughout the platform. Similarly, you can always contribute more docs, richer docs,
insightful docs. Or maybe a cool blog post?

## Questions and issues

Please feel free to connect with us using the [discussion section](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling/discussions) of the main Docling repository.
