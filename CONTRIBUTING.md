# Contribution guidelines

## Contributing in General

Our project welcomes external contributions. If you have an itch, please feel free 
to scratch it.

To contribute code or documentation, please submit a pull request to the specific 
reporistory (e.g. beeai, beeai-framework, etc).

A good way to familiarize yourself with the codebase and contribution process is
to look for and tackle low-hanging fruit in the to the specific reporistory (e.g. 
beeai, beeai-framework, etc).
Before embarking on a more ambitious contribution, create a discussion in the 
relevant repository. If you are unsure which repository is correct, you can
 open the discussion [at the org level](https://github.com/orgs/i-am-bee/discussions).

For general questions or support requests, please refer to the discussion 
section of the relevant reposttory. If you are unsure which repository is
 correct, you refer to [org level discussions](https://github.com/orgs/i-am-bee/discussions).

**Note: We appreciate your effort, and want to avoid a situation where a contribution
requires extensive rework (by you or by us), sits in backlog for a long time, or
cannot be accepted at all!**

### Proposing new features

If you would like to implement a new feature, please raise an issue in the relevant repository
before sending a pull request so the feature can be discussed. This is to avoid
you wasting your valuable time working on a feature that the project developers
are not interested in accepting into the code base.

### Fixing bugs

If you would like to fix a bug, please raise an issue in the relevant repository before sending a
pull request so it can be tracked.

### Merge approval

A pull request can be reviewed by any [committer](./GOVERNANCE.md#committer), but only
a [maintainer](./GOVERNANCE.md#maintainer) of the respective repository can merge it to
the main branch.

### Quick execution

The governance team favours quick iterations and execution. Contributors and committers are
encouraged to provide quick and effective feedback for finalizing the contributions.

Stale contributions will be flagged and eventually closed.

## Legal

Each source file must include a license header for Apache
2.0. Using the SPDX format is the simplest approach.
e.g.

```py
# Copyright © BeeAI a Series of LF Projects, LLC
# For web site terms of use, trademark policy and other project policies please see https://lfprojects.org.
```

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This
applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use the
same approach - the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/DCO1.1.txt) - that the Linux® Kernel [community](https://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin)
uses to manage code contributions.

We simply ask that when submitting a patch for review, the developer
must include a sign-off statement in the commit message.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the
submitter accepts the DCO:

```text
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your
local git repository using the following command:

```text
git commit -s
```

## Communication

Please feel free to connect with us using the [discussion section](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai/discussions) of the main BeeAI repository.
